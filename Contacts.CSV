Now, I just finished completing  a database for D03 ED 050 NB, attached.  Use this database to create a pivot table using macro we can add Budget Group, project status, highway Class and End PM to the Chart.

Hector,  

 

        I just found a selection issue on the template. I think I  can fix it very fast. 

        The template in this email doesn’t include the chart generation step, but has the most important part: the calculation of each length and collapsing the same years in one line. 

       You need to copy the data from the last sheet to a new sheet and then delete the columns you don’t want and press F11. 

       When I fix the little bug, I will send you again.

Good afternoon Tom I hope all is well?

We’re working on a project that requires the use of the “ivision” video to gather items of interest for our Physical Highway Inventory system. We see the data currently available is about 4 years old. The last time we spoke with someone from your office, and I can’t remember the name of your employee, he said a new video would be coming out soon. Can you direct me to someone who may be currently working of this?

Any help from you would be greatly appreciated.

Does Jasper Report or Sql Developer allow you to change your password?  If not, do you have SQLPlus installed on your pc?  If you login with SQLPlus, it will prompt you to enter a new password.  If all else fails, I can reset your password, but you should have a tool that allows you to change your password whenever you want.

Subject: RE: Sample/Test Database

 

Kevin, 

 

        Jasper Reports is similar to Access and Crystal Report. We can design report templates and generate reports with external data source. (Access has internal data source.)

 

        I have attached a screen shot of Jasper Reports. (See attachment WhatisJasperReport.png)

        You can see a long Sql query in the middle. After typing the query the field names would show right below it. 

        We need those field names when designing report templates. 

        We can preview the query result at the bottom also. (See PreviewData.png)

 

        I have access to the following link now.  https://hosting.agileassets.com/pms_ca/Kernel/w_login.jsp. 

        I can find column names and data types of each field for some tables there, but that is not what I want. 

 

        I don’t know which database is good for testing. If they have the same structure that will work. 

        Which version of Oracle Database are you using,  11g or older? 

        Currently, I need access to the following tables/views for the design. 

        (ca_ea_benefit_vw, pms_analysis_scenario_wp, pms_analysis_scenario, pms_analysis_scenario, setup_loc_ident, setup_ca_county, setup_column_id)

        I need to take a look at the relations, field names, field types, etc. I also need real access to the tables/views to test the Sql queries.  

 

        I have attached a screen shot of how to deploy the templates for auto report generation also. (See InsertJasperReport.png and ShowReport.png )

        Basically, we just need to insert Jasper Report and then right click to show report in PaveM. 

        I have also attached a page of a deliverable report for reference. (See forReference.pdf)

 

Thanks,

Jing,

 

I have a few questions on your request.

 

1)       What is Jasper reports and how is it deployed?

2)      The reports that you are creating, are they canned reports that users will request?  How will they request the report(s)?

3)      There are three user schemas in the PaveM database: PMS_CA, PMS_CA_TRN, and CA_PAVEM.  Which schema(s) do you need access to?

Hi Kevin, 

 

I am doing Jasper reports, which requires SQL query. 

I need to test my report templates through the Oracle Database frequently. 

After the testing I will upload the templates to PaveM system for auto report generation. 

However, I don’t have real access to the Oracle Database now. 

Currently, PaveM only shows schema of a few tables/views. I needs all the schema and the corresponding data. 

Can you give me the required information to connect to the sample/test database? 

Alternatively, can you export the sample/test database to a sql script? 

I can run the script in SQL Developer to import the data to my local database. 

I am using Oracle Database 11g Release 2 and Sql Developer  Version 4.0.2.15. 

If needed I can show you my PC screen to clarify my request through an online application like GoToMeeting. 

 

Regards,

Your password has been reset to: jzhao234

 

Also,  I was able to get the “Reset Password” menu option to work in SQL Developer 4.0.1 and 4.0.2.  You need to install the Oracle Instant Client version 12.1.  Then under the “Tools” menu in SQL Developer, select Preferences.

 



 

Then under Database, select Advanced.

 



 

Click on the “Use Oracle Client” check box.  Click the “Configure” button.

 



 

For Client_Type select Instant Client.  Then browse to the instant client directory.  Then click the Test button and check for success.

 

Testing the Instant Client located at D:\Oracle_software\Windows Client\SQL Developer\instantclient-basiclite-windows.x64-12.1.0.1.0\instantclient_12_1

Testing client directory ... OK

Testing loading Oracle JDBC driver ... OK

Testing checking Oracle JDBC driver version ... OK

  Driver version: 12.1.0.1.0

Testing testing native OCI library load ... OK

Success!

Does Jasper Report or Sql Developer allow you to change your password?  If not, do you have SQLPlus installed on your pc?  If you login with SQLPlus, it will prompt you to enter a new password.  If all else fails, I can reset your password, but you should have a tool that allows you to change your password whenever you want.

Kevin, 

 

        Jasper Reports is similar to Access and Crystal Report. We can design report templates and generate reports with external data source. (Access has internal data source.)

 

        I have attached a screen shot of Jasper Reports. (See attachment WhatisJasperReport.png)

        You can see a long Sql query in the middle. After typing the query the field names would show right below it. 

        We need those field names when designing report templates. 

        We can preview the query result at the bottom also. (See PreviewData.png)

 

        I have access to the following link now.  https://hosting.agileassets.com/pms_ca/Kernel/w_login.jsp. 

        I can find column names and data types of each field for some tables there, but that is not what I want. 

 

        I don’t know which database is good for testing. If they have the same structure that will work. 

        Which version of Oracle Database are you using,  11g or older? 

        Currently, I need access to the following tables/views for the design. 

        (ca_ea_benefit_vw, pms_analysis_scenario_wp, pms_analysis_scenario, pms_analysis_scenario, setup_loc_ident, setup_ca_county, setup_column_id)

        I need to take a look at the relations, field names, field types, etc. I also need real access to the tables/views to test the Sql queries.  

 

        I have attached a screen shot of how to deploy the templates for auto report generation also. (See InsertJasperReport.png and ShowReport.png )

Ok so it looks basically good but the query is this now:

 

       and a.eff_year >= $P{EFF_YEAR}

       and TO_NUMBER (SUBSTR (a.ca_ea_no, 1, 2)) = $P{CA_DISTRICT_ID}

 

Which is year > = the user entered year and the district equal to the user entered district.

 

If you want the ability to leave the parameter blank you should modify the query to this:

 

       and (a.eff_year >= $P{EFF_YEAR} or $P{EFF_YEAR} is null)

Eric,

 

For report 1 and 2, please help add two more pull-downs in this dialog box. One for District (include D1, … D12, and also All Districts); and one for Year (meaning analysis years, we may run report for a certain year only). Thank you.

Subject: Test Request: Change of parameters of groovy script

 

Eric and Jeremy, 

 

Per our discussions yesterday, I believe the cluttered index might be caused in part by the thresholds we set for the cracking distress. These thresholds are shown below:

 

benThreshold[0]=30.0;

benThreshold[1]=2.0;

benThreshold[2]=10.0;

benThreshold[3]=0.25;

 

I want to do a test by setting 

 

benThreshold[0]=100.0;

benThreshold[1]=2.0; (what is the ceiling for FTCV? 5?)

benThreshold[2]=100.0;

benThreshold[3]=0.25; (what is the ceiling for faulting? 6 inches?)

 

Can I touch the groovy scripts? I will document what I will do so I can put it back if it did not work. 

 

Zhongren

It appears that to reset an expired password in SQL Developer, you need to do the following.

 

SQL Developer has a built-in reset password option that may work for your situation. It requires adding Oracle Instant Client to the workstation as well. When instant client is in the path when SQL developer launches you will get the following option enabled:



Oracle Instant Client does not need admin privileges to install, just the ability to write to a directory and add that directory to the users path. Most users have the privileges to do this.

Recap: In order to use Reset Password on Oracle SQL Developer:

1.	You must unpack the Oracle Instant Client in a directory
2.	You must add the Oracle Instant Client directory to the users path
3.	You must then restart Oracle SQL Developer

At this point you can right click a data source and reset your password.

See http://www.thatjeffsmith.com/archive/2012/11/resetting-your-oracle-user-password-with-sql-developer/ for a complete walk-through 

Also see the comment in the oracle docs: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E35137_01/appdev.32/e35117/dialogs.htm#RPTUG41808

Kevin, 

 

        Jasper Reports is similar to Access and Crystal Report. We can design report templates and generate reports with external data source. (Access has internal data source.)

 

        I have attached a screen shot of Jasper Reports. (See attachment WhatisJasperReport.png)

        You can see a long Sql query in the middle. After typing the query the field names would show right below it. 

        We need those field names when designing report templates. 

        We can preview the query result at the bottom also. (See PreviewData.png)

 

        I have access to the following link now.  https://hosting.agileassets.com/pms_ca/Kernel/w_login.jsp. 

        I can find column names and data types of each field for some tables there, but that is not what I want. 

 

        I don’t know which database is good for testing. If they have the same structure that will work. 

        Which version of Oracle Database are you using,  11g or older? 

        Currently, I need access to the following tables/views for the design. 

        (ca_ea_benefit_vw, pms_analysis_scenario_wp, pms_analysis_scenario, pms_analysis_scenario, setup_loc_ident, setup_ca_county, setup_column_id)

        I need to take a look at the relations, field names, field types, etc. I also need real access to the tables/views to test the Sql queries.  

 

        I have attached a screen shot of how to deploy the templates for auto report generation also. (See InsertJasperReport.png and ShowReport.png )

        Basically, we just need to insert Jasper Report and then right click to show report in PaveM. 

        I have also attached a page of a deliverable report for reference. (See forReference.pdf)

Jing,

 

I have a few questions on your request.

 

1)       What is Jasper reports and how is it deployed?

2)      The reports that you are creating, are they canned reports that users will request?  How will they request the report(s)?

3)      There are three user schemas in the PaveM database: PMS_CA, PMS_CA_TRN, and CA_PAVEM.  Which schema(s) do you need access to?

Hi Kevin, 

 

I am doing Jasper reports, which requires SQL query. 

I need to test my report templates through the Oracle Database frequently. 

After the testing I will upload the templates to PaveM system for auto report generation. 

However, I don’t have real access to the Oracle Database now. 

Currently, PaveM only shows schema of a few tables/views. I needs all the schema and the corresponding data. 

Can you give me the required information to connect to the sample/test database? 

Alternatively, can you export the sample/test database to a sql script? 

I can run the script in SQL Developer to import the data to my local database. 

I am using Oracle Database 11g Release 2 and Sql Developer  Version 4.0.2.15. 

If needed I can show you my PC screen to clarify my request through an online application like GoToMeeting. 

 

Regards,

Does Jasper Report or Sql Developer allow you to change your password?  If not, do you have SQLPlus installed on your pc?  If you login with SQLPlus, it will prompt you to enter a new password.  If all else fails, I can reset your password, but you should have a tool that allows you to change your password whenever you want.

Eric, 
 
Let me know whether you can do a GTM with us on your first day back. This is the things we would like to discuss and resolve. 
 

1.	Step through the benefit calculation process. 
2.	Add District pull-down in REPORT 1 and 2
3.	Resolve the filter problem with Preservation Index column (no filtering can be applied for that column.).
4.	Add ‘stretching’ algothms to stretch the boundaries of the programmed projects based on the finest partition. 
5.	Include support costs for MWP?

Subject: RE: Sample/Test Database

 

Kevin, 

 

        Jasper Reports is similar to Access and Crystal Report. We can design report templates and generate reports with external data source. (Access has internal data source.)

 

        I have attached a screen shot of Jasper Reports. (See attachment WhatisJasperReport.png)

        You can see a long Sql query in the middle. After typing the query the field names would show right below it. 

        We need those field names when designing report templates. 

        We can preview the query result at the bottom also. (See PreviewData.png)

 

        I have access to the following link now.  https://hosting.agileassets.com/pms_ca/Kernel/w_login.jsp. 

        I can find column names and data types of each field for some tables there, but that is not what I want. 

 

        I don’t know which database is good for testing. If they have the same structure that will work. 

        Which version of Oracle Database are you using,  11g or older? 

        Currently, I need access to the following tables/views for the design. 

        (ca_ea_benefit_vw, pms_analysis_scenario_wp, pms_analysis_scenario, pms_analysis_scenario, setup_loc_ident, setup_ca_county, setup_column_id)

        I need to take a look at the relations, field names, field types, etc. I also need real access to the tables/views to test the Sql queries.  

 

        I have attached a screen shot of how to deploy the templates for auto report generation also. (See InsertJasperReport.png and ShowReport.png )

        Basically, we just need to insert Jasper Report and then right click to show report in PaveM. 

        I have also attached a page of a deliverable report for reference. (See forReference.pdf)

 

Thanks, 

 

Jing Hua Zhao

Jing,

 

I have a few questions on your request.

 

1)       What is Jasper reports and how is it deployed?

2)      The reports that you are creating, are they canned reports that users will request?  How will they request the report(s)?

3)      There are three user schemas in the PaveM database: PMS_CA, PMS_CA_TRN, and CA_PAVEM.  Which schema(s) do you need access to?

Hi Kevin, 

 

I am doing Jasper reports, which requires SQL query. 

I need to test my report templates through the Oracle Database frequently. 

After the testing I will upload the templates to PaveM system for auto report generation. 

However, I don’t have real access to the Oracle Database now. 

Currently, PaveM only shows schema of a few tables/views. I needs all the schema and the corresponding data. 

Can you give me the required information to connect to the sample/test database? 

Alternatively, can you export the sample/test database to a sql script? 

I can run the script in SQL Developer to import the data to my local database. 

I am using Oracle Database 11g Release 2 and Sql Developer  Version 4.0.2.15. 

If needed I can show you my PC screen to clarify my request through an online application like GoToMeeting. 

 

Regards,

"Preservation Index Calculation","Jeremy and Eric, 

Could you pls help confirm whether this is the way the preservation benefit index is determined in PaveM? Jing and I read into the codes, and this is the best I can grasp. Pls let us know. 

Also, please let us know how project lane miles and costs played into this index, is it just the area between the curve, or have considered the length and costs of the project. 

Another topic we will focus is WHY the index has such a wide range. See the attached spreadsheet. On the other hand, why some of the project share the same index value (too much cluttered).

Hi,

This is the current Matlab code.  I believe it is self contained.  It needs two spreadsheets - which are direct exports from PaveM.  One is the list of segments (Roadway > Database > PaveM Management Sections) and the other is the results from a scenario.  I've not run this with new results for a little while, so there might be some column name changes that need to be handled.

Eric, 

Let me know whether you can do a GTM with us on your first day back. This is the things we would like to discuss and resolve. 

(1)	Step through the benefit calculation process. 
(2)	Add District pull-down in REPORT 1 and 2
(3)	Resolve the filter problem with Preservation Index column (no filtering can be applied for that column.).
(4)	Add ‘stretching’ algothms to stretch the boundaries of the programmed projects based on the finest partition. 
(5)	Include support costs for MWP?

In your email, you mentioned the coarse segmentation and the boundaries. This reminds me of the grouping tool. Is it possible for us to have a copy of the grouping tool? I do not mind it is in Matlab, or whatsoever language, I will need to delve into that. Thank you.

"RE: Negative Benefit - SJ-012","Thank you Jeremy for the investigation. In Scenario #1366, there are a total of 18 programmed projects (L/R separated as shown) showed negative preservation benefit values. Could you please help delve into those, to confirm whether they are caused by similar reasons? If it is, it just proved that there should not be negative values, and every time when we see a negative value, we should work to fix the overlapping postmiles and re-run PaveM. We also talked with Eric to develop an algorithm to stretch the boundaries of the programmed projects according to the finest partitions (I know you have done it one time outside of PaveM). 

 

Gerry and I did some tests also. We found for the same SJ 12 project, if the medium overlay is applied 5 years into the future (year 2020), then the benefit also becomes positive. See Scenario #1368-1370. 

 

More importantly, I want to step through the benefit calculation process. This is an essential step for us to develop more confidence of the ranking index. I will set up a GTM with Eric this Thursday.

Subject: Re: Negative Benefit - SJ-012

 

Hi all,

OK, so the network master was out of date, but it is the EA 10-0G800 that is causing trouble.  In Hector's files this project runs from PM 0.1 to 5.1.  This gets fixed up by my code to 0.000 to M5.087.  There is a bridge end at M5.002.  The 8a segmentation has a boundary at M5.01 (I'd have to talk to Jon to find the origin of that).  The Coarse segmentation has a boundary at M5.000 since there is a master work plan project at that point, which forces a break.

Because of the 0.087 mile overlap the coarse segmentation picks up 10-0G800 has the last maintenance for the M5.000 to 11.000 segment and because of the aging of the condition (and the fact that the completion date of the project is 12/24/2012 and the data collection date was 8/02/2012), the condition of the segment gets improved.  As a result it looks like it does not need maintenance and so the benefit of doing a project in 2015 is negative (the 2012 project is a thick overlay and the 2015 is a medium overlay).

Some things that can be done to fix this:


1. At the moment the as-built fix up code assumes that post miles are rounded to 0.1 miles, so it looks for bridges in +-0.05 miles, and snaps to them.  It then looks for other events.  In this case it finds an event at M5.087 and assumes that this was the postmile that was rounded to get 5.1 on the plans.  I could increase the range to +-0.1 miles and that would snap the 5.1 to M5.002 (the end of the bridge), which would then get moved to the start of the bridge and no longer overlap the coarse segment.

2. We could adjust the Updated Target Table queries in the Network Master to require at least 0.1 miles of overlap between a project and a segment before it was counted as a true reflection of past construction history.  Or even require that the as-built cover at least half the segment (overlaps the center).

3. We could do both.


Looking at Google Earth, the construction actually ran for about 1.2 miles after the end of the bridge (so about PM 6.5) so none of these solutions is correct.  Nor is the PM 5.0 start of the 2015 project.

None of these will remove negative benefits.  But as can be seen here, if we suppressed or removed the negative benefits we would not be alerted to the inconsistencies on the data.

Regards,

  -Jeremy

Hi,

The reason for the negative benefit appears to be that this section on SJ-012 last had an overlay in 2012 and now one is programmed for 2015.  However, I can't find the 2012 project in the as-built history where it should be, which makes me think the network master is out of date (both fine and coarse segmentation).  Can I reload/reage the Network Master for this route?

"RE: Negative Benefit - SJ-012","We have difficulty locating the referenced 2012 project (Contract ID 225905) in the PaveM Construction History.  Do you have an EA or Project ID for us to use? I have only found the following constructed projects on SJ-012:

 



 

 

If the Network Master (NM) is out-of-date, then it seems to make sense reloading/reaging the NM for State Route SJ-012.

Subject: Re: Negative Benefit

 

Hi,

The reason for the negative benefit appears to be that this section on SJ-012 last had an overlay in 2012 and now one is programmed for 2015.  However, I can't find the 2012 project in the as-built history where it should be, which makes me think the network master is out of date (both fine and coarse segmentation).  Can I reload/reage the Network Master for this route?

Regards,

Gerry, 

 

       I have figured out a way to hide the current year and past year automatically.

       For example, if you run the report on 1/1/2015 (Still Fiscal Year 2014/2015, i.e., 7/1/14 - 6/30/15), the report won’t show the records in 2014 2013 and 2015 2014. 

If you run the report on 7/1/2015 (Fiscal Year 2015/2016), the report won’t show the records in 2013, 2014 & 2015.  

       Another example, if you run it on 12/31/2014, the report won’t show the records in 2013 and 2014. (This one is correct.)

       Not sure whether this is the way you want because you are using different year system (July 1 is the beginning of the year). 

       Please tell me how do you exactly want to hide it.  

 

Thanks, 

 

Jing Hua Zhao

Zhongren, 

	I have a way to show you my screen remotely so you don't need to come to my little room when I have questions and need to show you my screen. 
      When I send you an invitation like this email you just need to open the attachment then you will be able to see my desktop screen. 
	There is some other better way to do that but the free version is not allowed for commercial use.

Eric, Still the same topic. I found PaveM acts on its own by changing the sequence of the decision trees. For example, the Coarse Tree for Calibration I just created, Node #1 and #4 are switched by the system. There should be a bug something out there. Please help check it out. Just confirmed again because no matter how I change the thresholds of the tree, the system is not performing the way it is supposed to be.  

 

Gerry, the current Tree for Coarse Segmentation is also WRONG! Node #2 and #4 was swapped. Node #2, in the current status is pointing to CAPM or Rehab type of treatment; which should be the content of Node #4. 

 

Zhongren

I believe that the temporary EA’s were blanked out when we were trying to fix the UCPRC “Multi-routes under One Temp EA” issue.  It appears that the reports are selecting records based on them.  Perhaps, that’s the reason for the empty reports or missing scenario recommended projects.

 

After I ran the “Fill Temporary EA Numbers” command using Scenario #1307, the reports were able to pick up the scenario recommended projects.  I have regenerated and given the first & third reports for this Subdivided Funding scenario to Tom for Amarjeet.

	The temp EA generation procedure is not incorporated in the report generating routine. So all scenarios other than #1306 will not populate in the report as desired. Could you please help check on that? 

	 

	The following issues were identified: 

	(1)   For #1307, and #1308, the ‘Show Report’ tool will not populate all the records in the scenario result;

	(2)   The other two report template will not even populate, giving only empty reports.

Any time we may get together tomorrow? Say 30 minutes? I have some questions about the Jesper report. We just hired a student, and we want him to grasp as much as possible of reporting generating capability. 

 

Also, want to check with you about the Traffic-Weighted Cracking index, have we ever created one? 

 

Thank you.

"Possible way to resolve the first Jasper report.","1. Using subreport to list the details of each EA group. 


2. <dataSourceExpression><![CDATA[$P{REPORT_DATA_SOURCE}.cloneDataSource()]]></dataSourceExpression>


3.http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jasper_reports/jasper_quick_guide.htm


4. Don't do <dataSourceExpression><![CDATA[$P{REPORT_DATA_SOURCE}]]></dataSourceExpression>


5. Maybe you should use <connectionExpression><![CDATA[$P{REPORT_CONNECTION}]]></connectionExpression>
    instead <dataSourceExpression><![CDATA[$P{REPORT_DATA_SOURCE}]]></dataSourceExpression>


6. You can pass datasource via the built-in REPORT_DATA_SOURCE parameter.

The example:

<subreport>
    <reportElement x=""261"" y=""25"" width=""200"" height=""100""/>
    <dataSourceExpression><![CDATA[$P{REPORT_DATA_SOURCE}]]></dataSourceExpression>
    <subreportExpression><![CDATA[$P{SUBREPORT_DIR} + ""subreport.jasper""]]></subreportExpression>
</subreport>


7. You can create new instance of datasource based on variable, parameter or field.

The sample:

<variable name=""HeadingsCollection"" class=""java.util.Collection"" calculation=""System"">
    <initialValueExpression><![CDATA[new java.util.ArrayList()]]></initialValueExpression>
</variable>
...
<subreport>
    <reportElement x=""0"" y=""0"" width=""515"" height=""20""/>
    <subreportParameter name=""ReportTitle"">
        <subreportParameterExpression><![CDATA[$P{ReportTitle}]]></subreportParameterExpression>
    </subreportParameter>
    <dataSourceExpression><![CDATA[new net.sf.jasperreports.engine.data.JRBeanCollectionDataSource($V{HeadingsCollection})]]></dataSourceExpression>
    <subreportExpression class=""java.lang.String""><![CDATA[""HeadingsReport.jasper""]]></subreportExpression>
</subreport>


8. Another sample:
<field name=""cast"" class=""java.util.Collection""/>
...
<subreport>
    <reportElement positionType=""Float"" x=""15"" y=""25"" width=""245"" height=""20"" isRemoveLineWhenBlank=""true"" backcolor=""#99CCFF""/>
    <dataSourceExpression><![CDATA[new JRBeanCollectionDataSource($F{cast})]]></dataSourceExpression>
    <subreportExpression class=""java.lang.String""><![CDATA[""JRMDbCastSubreport.jasper""]]></subreportExpression>
</subreport>


9. Or you can pass the datasource via the parameter:
<parameter name=""SubreportDataSource"" class=""net.sf.jasperreports.engine.JRDataSource""/>
...
<subreport>
    <reportElement positionType=""Float"" x=""15"" y=""25"" width=""245"" height=""20"" isRemoveLineWhenBlank=""true""/>
    <dataSourceExpression>$P{SubreportDataSource}</dataSourceExpression>
    <subreportExpression class=""java.lang.String""><![CDATA[""Subreport.jasper""]]></subreportExpression>

"RE: Message from Jing. ","Hi Jing

 

For highways, GHG is generated in two ways.

 

1.       By the vehicles that run over the pavement.    There is early proof that concrete highways cause vehicles to use about 2-3% less fuel than asphalt highways.   It is not entirely known why, but early assumptions are either that the surface is a bit “stickier” or else that AC  deflects a bit.  It may also have to do with roughness, but empirical testing is not proving that.  Nevertheless, if we could improve the smoothness of highways and/or make them concrete, and have 300,000 vehicles use 2% less fuel, then the savings by ADT would be significant.

2.       The other cause of GHG is the mere construction of the highway.    The mining of the aggregate, trucking it to the site, and all the construction activities account for quite a bit of GHG.   Also, the materials manufacturing causes significant GHG release.   Asphalt must be heated to 350 degrees, and the energy to do that results in a great deal of co2 release.  Thus warm asphalt is of great interest because it only has to be heated to 250 degrees.   As for concrete manufacturing, the cement is very GHG intensive.  In fact cement is perhaps the most GHG producing product that mankind makes.   In China alone, which just passed the USA in terms of total GHG release, cement accounts for 30% of their total GHG output.  Also, every ton of cement produced releases about 1 ton of CO2.  (There is a side point here that if we can make our highways last longer, before first rehabilitation, than we would be making great savings.  )  

 

Both of these reasons are in some ways related to ADT.    Number one is obvious, but for number 2, we consider that if a highway is in construction for 1-3 years, there is a certain amount of construction induced traffic delay which results in cars moving slower and thus GHG generation.   More cars sitting in traffic control  means more GHG being produced.   The models we hope to produce will account for all of these factors.   There are studies being conducted all over the world, by universities, private companies, and transportation agencies to consider these aspects of GHG generation on highways.  While most of the world thinks about GHG generation from the bottom of the tire up, we need to think of ways to save GHG from the bottom of the tire down.     

 

I am sure there are other points some may want to point out.

I get the correlation between ADT and GHG now. They are kind of inverse related to each other. GHG should be small when ADT/ADTT is big, correct?    Jing

"RE: Benefit numbers","That looks pretty good especially with Report 3 for the “Scenario Recommended” projects, when there is no negative values.

 



 

However, if you run Reports 1 & 2 with Statewide Programmed Projects (SAP), then we will have some negative values.  Are we going to normalize the smallest negative number to 1?  Or else, we will have negative indices.  I do believe that we need to utilize the minimum value as well in the normalization process.  Please take a look at this.

 

Another minor comment will be, we won’t need to have accuracy down to the 9th decimal places for the normalized number (as shown in your spreadsheet) especially after we normalize it to 40.

"RE: Important message from Jing.","Hi Jing

 

Speaking for myself and others in the office, we are very grateful to have you working here.  You have very valuable and unique talents and have been very helpful, and the search that Peter did to find you proved valuable.    You are very smart and a hard worker.  

 

At this link are the minimum requirements for the classification that Hector works in.   Unfortunately I do not have any openings in that position.   It is possible that you meet those minimum requirements, but I am not sure.  You would have to take the test (on-line) and then get on the list to be considered for an interview if there is an opening soon.   I have an opening for a Senior Transportation Engineer, (the one that Charles just left) but you are not eligible for that position.   

 

http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/jobs/Duty_Statements/transportation_engineer_civil.pdf 

 

I recommend that you also explore the following link to see if there are positions that you would be eligible for.  

 

http://jobs.spb.ca.gov/wvpos/search_p.cfm?dept=transportation

 

The reason I asked what area you are currently educated in, and asked what your degree was in, is because if you can tell Zhongren, Gerry and me what type of career(s) you would really like to have, then we can help you to find if there are jobs at Caltrans for you.  This is important to know because you must meet what are called Minimum Requirements in order to be able to “test” for a job, and then get on a list to be able to interview.  It is not so easy to navigate your way through the job process in state government, and the rules don’t always make sense, so we’d happy to help.   If you need a reference, I will be happy to tell you that working here, and doing a good job.   Being able to use us a reference will be very valuable, even if you cannot get the pay you so desire.  

 

I have one more recommendation…  It is the same advice that my father gave me when I started college to be a civil engineer…  My dad told me that any engineer could do the engineering part, to stand apart I needed to be able to speak and write well.  He recommended that I take as many writing and speaking courses as I could.   Which I did.   They were very difficult courses for me, but they got easier as I went.   Now I am very comfortable to write and speak, but it took a great deal of effort.  As you prepare for interviews, jobs, and  a career, it is very important to be able to teach those who not scientifically minded (as well as those who are) what you did, and can do, regarding your work.  

 

Please let me know if you have any other questions.  

 

-Tom

Hi Tom, 

 

        You conveyed very important message to me during the short conversation last Friday afternoon and during the GTM last Tuesday. 

        And you might have known that the HR people will not raise the pay rate for me with the current materials. 

        Again, people are nice and the work is easy. I have finished four major report automations, EA Summary Report 1, 2, 3 and Chart for Scenario#_D#_County_Route#_DIR_PM. 

        I am very interested in working in this office. Is there any fulltime openings available that I can try now?

        I had worked in a kitchen cabinet company as a Sales Engineer for two years, in Sac City as a Calculus Tutor for three years, and in UC Berkeley as a Reader(grade homework and help in lab session) for two engineering classes for 1 year. My cumulative GPA is around 3.6 out of 4.  

        You asked whether I am more EE or CS. The following is the list of the non-humanity courses for my B.S. degree. 

        Please respond.

Hi Peter

 

One more thing on this topic.

 

Please prepare a similar email that I will send to Chuck Suszko that can be forwarded to the construction RE’s in the state.  That one would not have the username info on it, but would include info on how to get a user ID.  We will eventually roll that particular email to the District Maintenance Engineers also.

Subject: Introducing a New Statewide Pavement Core Database

 

Pavement Coring Personnel,

 

Caltrans needs to make pavement core data available to all the functional units in the department.  To accomplish this goal a web-based application was developed by the Pavement Program to track and store core data generated by our projects.  The core information is entered via an application developed by UCPRC at UC Davis called iGPR-Core.  This simple application presents all the available core data locations on a Google map where each location can be selected showing detailed core information, as shown below. Currently,  iGPR-Core contains data for over 3,000 cores statewide and new ones get added all the time.  

 



 

Before this application can be used, the user must register to verify their identity.

Subject: Introducing a New Statewide Pavement Core Database

 

Pavement Coring Personnel,

 

Caltrans needs to make pavement core data available to all the functional units in the department.  To accomplish this goal a web-based application was developed by the Pavement Program to track and store core data generated by our projects.  The core information is entered via an application developed by UCPRC at UC Davis called iGPR-Core.  This simple application presents all the available core data locations on a Google map where each location can be selected showing detailed core information, as shown below. Currently,  iGPR-Core contains data for over 3,000 cores statewide and new ones get added all the time.  

 



 

Before this application can be used, the user must register to verify their identity.  This requires you to go to the first link below and click on the “Register” button, as shown in the “Login to Site” section above.  A screen will appear where you enter your name, district, a password, a security question and response, then click on the “Create User” button.  After you have registered, you will have to wait for the system administrator to verify the information you have provided.  Two Emails notes will be sent to you, after that you will be able to login with your user name and password.    

 

The link to gain access to the iGPR-Core application is:

Please take some time and try this new application, then let me know if it suits your needs and how we could improve it.  In the future, we would like to have the contractor enter data core results directly into this system.

Joe…

 

Can I please get the financial breakdown per fiscal year of the proposed budget for the PaveM contract with UCPRC? I need to report to Tony (Michelle) so that he sets aside the allocation in his budget.

 

Also, do not forget to include the support dollars that was moved over to the other UCPRC contract.

Thanks,

Joe…

 

Can I please get the financial breakdown per fiscal year of the proposed budget for the PaveM contract with UCPRC? I need to report to Tony (Michelle) so that he sets aside the allocation in his budget.

 

Also, do not forget to include the support dollars that was moved over to the other UCPRC contract.

Thanks,

 

Nick

"PaveM Contract","Hi John and Zhongren

 

With regard to attached list of projects (RE: PPRC Spending Plan), while there are projects listed, I do not know where they came from.   I would like to start a discussion of how these were developed and examine the estimates.   Please be prepared to make changes to the list.  

 

A good place to start will be the meeting minutes that Jon Lea provided from the October 31, 2013 meeting on “Next Priorities”.    I just have a hard copy of these.  

 

Zhongren will be the lead on reviewing the projects and prioritizing any new tasks to be added.  Please look for a meeting invitation from him.  After we have a first cut of the projects, we will run them past the pavement office chiefs and the SPE, so everyone is aware of what the PaveM priorities are and what the goals for development are.     

 

Thanks,

-Tom

"Overlapping of As-Built Plan Treatments","Eric and Jeremy, 

 

This is to follow up on our GTM on 8/21/14.  We discussed the issue of the wrongful assignment of treatment for neighboring segments of those shown in as-built plans. At that time, we implemented a rule that the overlapping must be longer than 20% of the neighboring segment length before the neighboring segment takes the treatment shown in the as-built plan. As described on page 23 of the attached document, this rule has some exceptions when the neighboring segment is really short. 

 

*         I suggest that we implement Rule #3. The overlapping length must be longer than 0.1 mile, and must be more than 10% of the neighboring (Red) segment length before the as-built plan treatment is applied to the neighboring segment.

 

Please help verify my reasoning, and help implement in the groovy script. Let me know if you have any questions. (this rule may also have exceptions, but may be more robust than the one we put in currently.)

The last column is normalized from 0 – 40, based on the value in the second to the last column. The minimum becomes 0 and the maximum becomes 40.

As I look at this, I am thinking we should rate the cracking benefit on a scale of 0-100, and IRI benefit on a scale of 0-50 (to show it has less value).  Does this make sense to you?  I think it would show we are working on a scale that people know intuitively.

Subject: RE: 05-0L7014 Submittal.73.Data Cores (after coring)

 

Hello Kyle, 

First, thank you for the core information.  Just to let you know, this core information will be used to update our Pavement Management System (PaveM), which has all off the California's highway structural sections in one place.  Being that this information is going into a database, the information needs to be in an electronic format (MS-Excel or Word, or some sort of format that would allow us to rip the information instead of re-typing).  In addition, it is hard to see the core with the pictures being so dark, I am hoping that by stretching the pictures we could see the core layers.  

 

Nevertheless, Caltrans is working on changing the Standard Specifications with this update.  Meanwhile, getting this information electronically now would help this office immensely.  Again, if you could submit the same previously submitted file, but in Excel or Word, we would appreciate it.

 

Second, we have also attached an example of a new Core Submittal Form that Caltrans has been working on in an attempt to standardize the coring submittals.  As you can see, there is a picture of the location of where the core was taken from (""x"" marks the spot where the core was taken, see picture below), we use this information to verify the core's GPS coordinates with the Caltrans Photolog and/or Caltrans-Google Map.  Note the post mile paddle in the picture.  In the future, would you please use this form, we would appreciate it.  Caltrans has invested a good amount of money and time on this PaveM project, therefore, these cores are vital to Caltrans.



 

 

Finally, we are also working on being able to load core information on-line in-lieu of hardcopy, where contractors are be able to enter the data information straight into the new PaveM database automatically.  

Here is the links to see all cores:

http://www.ucprc.ucdavis.edu/iGPR/

 

And here is the link to register and load core data, if you choose to. We also added the iGPR Core instructions for your use.

Thanks again for all your cooperation,

Subject: Introducing a New Statewide Pavement Core Database

 

Pavement Coring Personnel,

 

Caltrans needs to make pavement core data available to all the functional units in the department.  To accomplish this goal a web-based application was developed by the Pavement Program to track and store core data generated by our projects.  The core information is entered via an application developed by UCPRC at UC Davis called iGPR-Core.  This simple application presents all the available core data locations on a Google map where each location can be selected showing detailed core information, as shown below. Currently,  iGPR-Core contains data for over 3,000 cores statewide and new ones get added all the time.  

 



 

Before this application can be used, the user must register to verify their identity.  This requires you to go to the first link below and click on the “Register” button, as shown in the “Login to Site” section above.  A screen will appear where you enter your name, district, a password, a security question and response, then click on the “Create User” button.  After you have registered, you will have to wait for the system administrator to verify the information you have provided.  Two Emails notes will be sent to you, after that you will be able to login with your user name and password.    

 

The link to gain access to the iGPR-Core application is:

 

 http://www.ucprc.ucdavis.edu/igpr-core/ <http://www.ucprc.ucdavis.edu/igpr-core/>  

 

The training materials for this application can be found at:

 

http://onramp.dot.ca.gov/hq/maint/pavement/GPR.shtml <http://onramp.dot.ca.gov/hq/maint/pavement/GPR.shtml> 

 

Please take some time and try this new application, then let me know if it suits your needs and how we could improve it.  In the future, we would like to have the contractor enter data core results directly into this system.

Btw, please let me know when you get results for the new run with coarse segmentation (CS).  I am hoping that Jing can run the CS for us.    Can you please run reports 1, 2, and 3 for district 4 for me?  Also, I ‘d like to see the Jing/Hector Pivot chart for route 1 (District 4).    I also would like to see if this run will be a good one to start to get results to have Bill Farnbach evaluate for us.  Thank you.

Thanks, Jing.  It looks good.  Per Tom’s recommendation, let’s revise it to 0 - 100.  Please put this report under the Public Special Report & let us know of the report name.

 

Now that I have caught up with all the 2014 SHOPP Amendments & Fiscal Year 2013/2014 HM projects in PaveM.  I am making another run similar to #1366, reflecting these amendments, to see if it makes much difference to the scenario recommended results.

The last column is normalized from 0 – 40, based on the value in the second to the last column. The minimum becomes 0 and the maximum becomes 40.           

Please compare the values in the two columns.

Gerry, 

 

        There is a more complicated query within the report template. It will take much more time to generate the report. 

        Click the Wait button when the window popups.   If you want to hide the original benefit column let me know.

Without the highway information none of the pavement analysis (from a GIS perspective) is going to happen.  That is the basis for 85% of our GIS analysis.

Not to mention our highway layer.  How long does it take you to generate this file?  

 

I thought Jeff requested this info before he retired 4 weeks ago.  It’s really up to all of you to decide how urgent this information is and if they want you to expedite generating the file.

 

Attached is your shapefile.

I will be super booked in the next couple of weeks because of the APCS contract as we are selecting a vendor in two weeks.  Some of my activities include analyzing data, answering RFP questions and evaluate the RFP on one week of September 22nd).  Besides I will be out of town all next week.  

 

In any case I will do my very best to give it to you the sooner I can.  If I could, I would drop everything I have to create the files you need.  Please let me know how urgent it is this file for you.  As you know, you will need to use the last fields I created for your pavement hot dog maps because we have not changed and will not change the highway log for this cycle.  As a result, I do not need to create a new highway log for our PCS crew.   

 

Thanks,


Dulce

I’ll take a look at the data today.

 

When are you planning on downloading a clean roads file?  Jeff would get this file from you between July and August.

We use it to create the TSN highway layer which is our primary information for all pavement analysis.  Could I get this file by next week?

 

Thanks,

Dear Dario:

 

Per our phone conversation yesterday, could you please create shape files for the attached locations?  We would like to use those files to collect pavement condition data with automated pavement condition survey vans.  I hope you have all the information you need!  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any additional information or have any questions.  

 

Many thanks,

Brian, Chad

 

The Pavement Program currently has the APCS contract in advertisement.  I have attached the final bid document.  We start contract evaluation on September 22nd.  

 

I would like to bring you up to date on the schedule.   

 

We expect to award the contract by the middle of October.   It will be shortly after that when we will be able to begin the collection.   In the contract we have allocated for 7000 miles of off-system NHS collection, as is shown in the screen shot of the 1st paragraph below.   The On-system will begin on January 2nd for the entire on-system network, and must be completed with-in 8 months.   The off-system has 12 months for completion.

 



 

Please note there are two things we need from your division:  

1.       We will need the LRS of the off system, to provide to the contractor, for this collection to begin, which will be as early as late October.  

2.       By mid December we must have the updated Caltrans LRS for the contractor to begin that collection.  

 

 

Please let me know when you can provide this information and if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely,

"Help please","Eric, 

 

We are trying to add in filters for the ‘reports’, so that jasper reports could be generated based on District, Year, Budget Group, pavement class, etc. So we are in need of your help in locating the query you used to speed up this process. For example, when we select a scenario number and then switch to the Results tab we can see/export the scenario result there. PaveM must have executed a query to generate the result. Can you please send us the Sql query for the scenario results?  

 

Also, can you please upload the query of the view ca_ea_benefit_vw or send us directly? We need these queries to add some fields to the reports.

 

Thank you.

Hey Zhongren,

 

Here is the EA Benefit view…..  the query for the window is not easily obtained.  I can try tomorrow but I am headed to the airport now.  See what you can do with this query in the meantime and I’ll get back to you.

Hello Amarjit

 

Please call me at your convenience to talk about the work and when you can start.   I hope you have a basic understanding of pavement repair and restoration strategies, but if not we can explain that pretty quickly.   We also need help with some work that involves reading asbuilts, and I am sure you are expert at that.   

 

Usually we sign a little agreement that lays out the work and the schedule.  I believe you would still be charging to D-3 construction:  Is that what you understand?

Hi Amy

 

Yes!   We need an engineer who can work with us to validate the projects that the pavement management system is suggesting.   I think it is interesting work :)     It would involve using excel, so he must be a little computer savvy;  we will definitely teach him what we need, and he would then be working with the team to check the output of the program.   We need someone who will get along with our office -and you know us- as we value the workplace atmosphere highly.  I do not know Randhawa’s last name, so please have him contact me.   

 

Thank you,

Are you open spot for a Construction loaners this winter?  Randhawa wanted to work with you last winter, but things didn’t work out.  He is available this winter if you are willing to take him in.  If yes, you can let Randhawa know as he needs to fill out a request soon.

Hi Theresa,

 

  On Tuesday  September 9th at 1300 during a moving lane closure for a spray operation one of our shadow vehicles was hit. The vehicle was completely off the travel way and on the left hand shoulder when the accident occurred. The ct employee was taken to the doctor and was off work for one day. As a reminder even when we do everything right accidents still occur.

"FW: Desired Functional Descriptions ","Hi Eric

 

Here is the excel file for the table we are creating.   Zhongren has listed some of the characteristics we like about it.

Subject: Desired Functional Descriptions 

 

 

 

In selecting projects in PaveM, it is best to display past projects, currently programmed projects, and future planned projects in a time-space diagram as the attached spreadsheet shows. Such a diagram allows the engineers to examine whether the proposed projects make any sense. In our imagination, the diagram could be interactive with the user, integrated with PaveM, and once finalized, could be printed out as reports. 

 

Some of the desired functions are listed below:

1.       Select the time-space window size: # of years, and length of a route to show. One can fix this, too. 20 years vertical, and 50 miles horizontal, for example. The diagram should allow the selection of any Co., Route, and PM limits to show. A reference state map may provide better orientation for the user. 

2.       Plot all historical projects archived in the as-built database;

3.       Select a scenario number, and plot as bar charts, all the programmed, and planned projects, following predefined legends. The bar charts should be able to display lane by lane, if the treatment is different across lanes. 

4.       For the scenario results, the project limits should be interactive, so that the user can stretch/shrink the limits of a certain project. Certainly the labeling should change as the bar size/type of treatment/budget group changes. The bar should also allow to be moved to a different year. In the mean time, such edits should be reflected in a table. 

5.       For each programmed or planned project, there should be a thumbnail display for iVision type of video clip. So that the user can examine the video to assist his/her reasoning. 

6.       This diagram is essentially a GUI.

7.       After all these edits, the edited projects, together with the un-editted projects should become ‘programmed’ projects. These programmed ones should run through PaveM again to determine priority. 

 

Is such a GUI doable? How soon?

Wow Mark,

 

That is an increasable seven pages of great information.  It is the everything you need to help yourself learn and understand the whole subject.  I encourage all the all my colleges to explore your report and share the information with their colleges, subordinates, supervisors and managers.  I see so many great training opportunities here it is unbelievable.  Thank you for assembling and sharing with us.

 

If you have any questions or need additional information please contact me.

 

Thanks,

-John

VDC and TAMP Colleagues,

 

Attached is a report for the recent Design to Paver event that I think you will find very informative.  The subject matter encompasses many of our VDC initiatives and paves the way for future TAMP, and the digital transportation infrastructure.

Subject: Design to Paver Event

 

SMB,

 

Attached is my report for the July 9-10, 2014 “Design to Paver” event in Corvallis, Oregon, sponsored by FHWA and hosted by ODOT. It was a great honor to have been selected to attend, and I am very grateful to those who approved Caltrans participation.  I was joined by Chuck Suszko, Division of Construction and Jesus Mora, Division of Design.  

 

https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_mp6bwlov <https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_mp6bwlov> 

 

I’ve incorporated a number of links from the event, as well as other related resources into the report to make it a “virtual” tour of the workshop for those unable to attend. I’ve shared this report with the HQ’s Project Delivery Division Chiefs and co-attendees, and received positive reaction. 

 

I would encourage the readers of this report to take the Self Assessment tool, attached, to gauge the level of maturity where they see we are “currently” with implementing these new technologies and paradigms across Caltrans. Outreach, training and education, are as critical as the new technologies/hardware/software, as well the need to update policies and guidance, procedures, etc.   

 

I am hopeful as we move from EDC2 to EDC3, we will continue to provide leadership by implementing these innovations as the building blocks for the future digital transportation infrastructure.   

 

Please feel free to pass along to your staff, others, including Design, Right of Way, Construction, Project Management, etc.    

 

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Hi guys,

 

Here are the other costs for 14/15FY:

 

Sri has 3 Asphalt conferences that we usually pay a registration fee for the Districts to attend for CALAPA is for both north and south conferences.  In the past the Division paid for them.

CalAPA                                $2,400

Chip Seal Assoc                 $1,200

3 staff in Leadership Trng  ?          Does this get charged to Division of Mtce or pavement pgm?

Training                              $3,000  

Mat Lab Software            $4,000  Tom Pyle

GIS software                      $2,000  Tom Pyle, we may have to pay a portion of the site GIS license fee.

Printers                               $8,000   We ordered 2 of them last year.  Payment will hit this year.  They are expensive to be able to print GIS maps on 11” X 17” at GWO and Lab

Computers                       $15,000   10 desktops or laptops are scheduled for replacement out of 30.  We down scoped to 10.  

TOTAL                               $35,600

 

Anything to add?

 

Thanks,

Susan

Hello there!

 

Please keep in mind whatever proposals you come up with,  they will need to first be vetted through our Division Chief.

 

If our DC approves then, from there, the districts will need to be contacted (the DDDM’s).

 

The intention of my email is to be transparent, with you both.  I don’t want to leave you with the impression that I have the authority to authorize resources from the districts.

 

The sooner you come up with your estimates,  the sooner I can run them through Melodie and then Tony.

Thanks for meeting with us today, Michelle.

 

On the 8th bullet (check) below, Nick may also have some planned work using district’s resources for pilot projects. He will also have to develop a draft plan for work to be performed by the district staff.

Thank you for your time today:

 

Wanted to re-cap the action items and a few discussions:

 

Action Items from Today’s meeting

 

*  13/14 Year end numbers “close out” number for the Pavement Office – Mohamed will provide by 09/03/2014 using AP 14 

*  Unit clean-up; We have all that is needed to do this, Mohamed will continue with the exercise and have this done by 09/12/2014

*  Training Allocation – Compile a list of needs and submit to the Budget Office (3 year expenditure data provided no allocation to the Pavement Offices) – Susan will provide this by _____?

*  Mohamed is going to perform additional research to determine why Training expenditures did not materialize in the 3 year historical expenditures

*  Currently we have set aside $355,000 set aside for PaveM (nick)

*  Currently we have set aside $4,000,000 for APCS

*  Cell phone/Communication costs needed to be spread to the Offices and not reflect only the the executive unit – Mohamed will do this and resend your MBS’s by 09/03/2014

*  Sri will put together the planned work from each district and identify the resources associated with this work – A subsequent dialog will need to occur with Sri, Mel and myself on how we want this to potentially roll out to the districts

*  Susan wanted all the columns hidden in your MBS for those object classes which show no allocation nor expenditures.

 

 

The following are still pending action items from our last meeting.

*  Finance Letter resources Perm $$ of 355K – I will communicate with Melodie what has been set aside and attempt to get that allocated asap (We will need to get final approval from our Div Chief)

*  For 15/16 identify Off the Top needs for Pavement from prior Finance letter resources that have now melded into our “Base” – The goal was to have the OTT’s on going from fy to fy (perpetual)

Team:

 

I’m re-capping the action items from today’s meeting.

 

*  We will utilize source unit 3476 for Amarjeet and change the description to match his current function.  Currently Allocation is to the 3476 unit #, the goal is to align expenditures with allocations

*  Encumbrance report – Mohamed will send this with the detailed information requested, so an effort can begin on researching original documents/transactions– Our goals is to spend old money first, and release any unnecessary encumbrances from prior fiscal years

*  Breakdown expenditures from 13/14 and display expenditure items in the comparison report we went over this morning.

*  Unit number clean up (rid all  references to D45, and update descriptions where necessary)

*  Finance Letter resources Perm $$ of 355K – I will communicate with Melodie what has been set aside and attempt to get that allocated asap (We will need to get final approval from our Div Chief)

*  For 15/16 identify Off the Top needs for Pavement from prior Finance letter resources that have now melded into our “Base” – The goal was to have the OTT’s on going from fy to fy (perpetual) 

*  Follow up meeting to be scheduled to review and discuss action items and roll out the 14/15 budgeted resources to the remaining Pavement O/C’s

 

 

I hope I captured everything.

 

Susan – I will schedule a meeting in a couple of weeks with you and the Pavement O/C’s – Mohamed and I will come to Ventura Oaks 

 

Thank you very much for taking the time to meet with us.  We look forward to working with you the remainder of the fiscal year.

Action items from meeting today with Sri.

 

Reporting Codes

 

1.      When was RC established

2.      When was it last updated

3.      Who’s using the RC

4.      Why are the codes being used

 

Once we get this info to Sri,  he will review and decide which ones to update/change and standardize

 

Understanding there is a form to update reporting codes,  we think it’s best we utilize the form for audit purposes

Subject: RE: Collection of the off system NHS

 

Tom,

 

I’m not the expert on LRS but I can attempt to answer your question.  For the off-system LRS, I reported the following to the Traffic Records Steering Committee, on behalf of our two offices:

*         June 16, 2014, a California, All Public Roads, LRS was submitted and accepted by FHWA, which met the federal requirement of ARNOLD.

o   The LRS that was submitted can be shared with our partners.  

o   There are standards for mapping data on the LRS which include a Route ID, Begin measures and End measures.

*         This completes Phase 1 of our efforts.

*         Phase 2 will be to make sure that attributes can be dynamically segmented onto the LRS, which is scheduled for completion by June 15, 2015, our next HPMS submittal.

 

Chad, correct me if I’m wrong but Phase 2 is what we are working on with the CSUs, with a goal to complete by May 1, 2014, and this effort is being led by your office.  It was supposed to have been completed by the last HPMS submittal but due to issues with the HPMS data, they did not accomplish the original scope.  This means that we do not have an automated way to provide GIS information for the off-system pavement data.  

 

That is why I explained to Dulce that it would be more difficult to provide shape files for the off-system compared to on-system.  It would require Chad’s staff to manually locate each area and create a shape file from scratch.  Our cracking length contractor was able to do this for us.  I could ask Kamal to provide you with the details of our off system pavement contract for cracking length.  In hind sight, we probably should have combined our efforts for all pavement data.  Our contractor mentioned that if we added IRI it wouldn’t have changed the bid.

 

Let me know if you would like to discuss,

For example, when we select a scenario number and then switch to the Results tab we can see/export the scenario result there. PaveM must have executed a query to generate the result. Can you please send us the Sql query for the scenario results?  

 

Also, can you please upload the query of the view ca_ea_benefit_vw or send us directly? We need these queries to add some fields to the reports.

 

Thank you.

Hi,

Is anyone running anything that would prevent me updating the as-builts with Hector's latest data?  After the update the Network Master (8a/Fine segmentation) will need to be updated and aged, and then the special scenario for the Coarse segmentation run, before uploading that and completely replacing the current Coarse segmentation.

Hi Tom,

 

Attached is the spreadsheet of off-system routes, with their beginning and end measures. This should help meet the RFP requirements on page 81, paragraph 2.2 to provide the off-system LRS. The total length of IRI is 4,733 miles. Please let Brian and I know if there is more information you may need from us. Thank you!

Subject: RE: Collection of the off system NHS

 

Tom,

 

I’m not the expert on LRS but I can attempt to answer your question.  For the off-system LRS, I reported the following to the Traffic Records Steering Committee, on behalf of our two offices:

*         June 16, 2014, a California, All Public Roads, LRS was submitted and accepted by FHWA, which met the federal requirement of ARNOLD.

o   The LRS that was submitted can be shared with our partners.  

o   There are standards for mapping data on the LRS which include a Route ID, Begin measures and End measures.

*         This completes Phase 1 of our efforts.

*         Phase 2 will be to make sure that attributes can be dynamically segmented onto the LRS, which is scheduled for completion by June 15, 2015, our next HPMS submittal.

 

Chad, correct me if I’m wrong but Phase 2 is what we are working on with the CSUs, with a goal to complete by May 1, 2014, and this effort is being led by your office.  It was supposed to have been completed by the last HPMS submittal but due to issues with the HPMS data, they did not accomplish the original scope.  This means that we do not have an automated way to provide GIS information for the off-system pavement data.  

 

That is why I explained to Dulce that it would be more difficult to provide shape files for the off-system compared to on-system.  It would require Chad’s staff to manually locate each area and create a shape file from scratch.  Our cracking length contractor was able to do this for us.  I could ask Kamal to provide you with the details of our off system pavement contract for cracking length.  In hind sight, we probably should have combined our efforts for all pavement data.  Our contractor mentioned that if we added IRI it wouldn’t have changed the bid.

 

Let me know if you would like to discuss,

Hi Tom,

 

We are on track to deliver the on-system LRS by October 6th (original estimate was September 22nd) which includes updates for the 37 routes with identified changes between the Jan 30, 2012  and Jan 30, 2014 TSN data queries.

 

I’ll let Brian cover the off-system LRS item.

Gentlemen

 

Please see the green highlight below…

 

The Pavement Program will need for you to provide the LRS for the off-system collection, which can begin as soon as the contract s awarded.   

 

Also, I will need the LRS for the Caltrans On-system by Mid December.  

 

When will these be delivered?

Brian, Chad

 

The Pavement Program currently has the APCS contract in advertisement.  I have attached the final bid document.  We start contract evaluation on September 22nd.  

 

I would like to bring you up to date on the schedule.   

 

We expect to award the contract by the middle of October.   It will be shortly after that when we will be able to begin the collection.   In the contract we have allocated for 7000 miles of off-system NHS collection, as is shown in the screen shot of the 1st paragraph below.   The On-system will begin on January 2nd for the entire on-system network, and must be completed with-in 8 months.   The off-system has 12 months for completion.

 



 

Please note there are two things we need from your division:  

1.       We will need the LRS of the off system, to provide to the contractor, for this collection to begin, which will be as early as late October.  

2.       By mid December we must have the updated Caltrans LRS for the contractor to begin that collection.  

 

 

Please let me know when you can provide this information and if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely,

I checked with Jing. We are interested in the query used in the result screen as shown in the enclosed screen shot. 

 

If the work plan grid is the same as the result grid, then either one will do.

Eric, 

 

We are trying to add in filters for the ‘reports’, so that jasper reports could be generated based on District, Year, Budget Group, pavement class, etc. So we are in need of your help in locating the query you used to speed up this process. For example, when we select a scenario number and then switch to the Results tab we can see/export the scenario result there. PaveM must have executed a query to generate the result. Can you please send us the Sql query for the scenario results?  

 

Also, can you please upload the query of the view ca_ea_benefit_vw or send us directly? We need these queries to add some fields to the reports.

 

Thank you.

 

Zhongren

Hi Tom,  

   

        I have got a fulltime offer as a software engineer. I will stay until next Friday, which is 9/26/2014. 

        In the coming days, I will try my best to generate instructions on how to use my automated templates.  

        I am very interested in working in this office. Please let me know when you have an opening (even a janitor engineer). 

 

Regards, 

 

Jing Hua Zhao

"Red Yellow and Green mileage for Class 3 Road","
Eric, 

Remember we classified the 50k lane miles into Green Yellow, and Red about a month ago? Now we are in need classifying Class 3 road into Green, Yellow, and Red using the same thresholds we used. Could you please help me add some routine like this shown below, but for class 3 road only? I will also need a report to display that. 

Jing also has some question for you. Will it be okay for us to have a GTM tomorrow morning, say 9am PST?

	Just to reiterate some of the details again:
	 
	1br rents for $495/mo. A month to month or 3 month lease is an additional monthly fee of $100, bringing the rent to $595/mo. A 6 mos lease is an additional $50.00, bringing the rent to $545/mo. Upon approval, a hold fee is required which is non refundable after 72 hours, and secures the apt for you for 30 days. This is applied to your deposit, lowering it to $300 the day of move in along with the rent(which will be prorated if moved in after the 1st). We pay water, sewer and trash, and the tenant is responsible for electric which typically runs about $45-$60 per month. We have coin operated washers and dryers in each building. Please include his offer letter, as this will speed up the process much quicker. We do a background check, check rental history and he must earn $1487.50 for a $595 and $1287.50 for $495. Please include his offer letter and rental history and anticipated move in date, as this will speed up the process much quicker.  Any other questions, just let me know!

Hey Zhongren I cannot get to it tonight as I am at my sons soccer practice and do not have my computer. If I remember right the column name is ca_class_no and it can be added to query exactly like the others if you guys want to try. Otherwise I'll look first thing tomorrow.

Below is a note I just sent to the PCCP and AC industries.   I really want to make sure we are being open and transparent of the info we are making available to the industries.  If there is other info, let’s start a discussion…

Dear Russell and Tom

 

The department has  ground penetrating radar data from a couple of years ago.   It is in processed, and could potentially be of use to your members.  It has been requested by an organization that would fall with Tom’s scope.   We have not been able to determine a simple way to transfer this data, via online means, due to restrictions in the departments firewalls.  

 

Tom, we will thus send you a disk of the requested data, which we have prepared from the University of California, Davis.

 

Russell, if you would like to let your members know this is available, I would be happy to forward a copy of this statewide data, by a CD.  Below is a sample and format of the data to show what it would look like.  Pay no attention to the color codings.

 



 



 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely, 

Tom Pyle

Hey Zhongren I cannot get to it tonight as I am at my sons soccer practice and do not have my computer. If I remember right the column name is ca_class_no and it can be added to query exactly like the others if you guys want to try. Otherwise I'll look first thing tomorrow.

The FHWA feedback letter states that we did not provide all of our IRI.  Did the Pavement Program provide a complete set of IRI DRISI?  I thought we did.  FHWA made the following note  “Of the 14,193.21 CL miles of NHS highways reported, IRI was populated on 12,432.2 CL miles of highway (87.59%), a 5% improvement over last year. IRI is required on all NHS highways, on certain Functional Systems and Samples.

Hi Tom,

 

We are on track to deliver the on-system LRS by October 6th (original estimate was September 22nd) which includes updates for the 37 routes with identified changes between the Jan 30, 2012  and Jan 30, 2014 TSN data queries.

 

I’ll let Brian cover the off-system LRS item.

 

Thanks,

Gentlemen

 

Please see the green highlight below…

 

The Pavement Program will need for you to provide the LRS for the off-system collection, which can begin as soon as the contract s awarded.   

 

Also, I will need the LRS for the Caltrans On-system by Mid December.  

 

When will these be delivered?  

 

Thank You,

Brian, Chad

 

The Pavement Program currently has the APCS contract in advertisement.  I have attached the final bid document.  We start contract evaluation on September 22nd.  

 

I would like to bring you up to date on the schedule.   

 

We expect to award the contract by the middle of October.   It will be shortly after that when we will be able to begin the collection.   In the contract we have allocated for 7000 miles of off-system NHS collection, as is shown in the screen shot of the 1st paragraph below.   The On-system will begin on January 2nd for the entire on-system network, and must be completed with-in 8 months.   The off-system has 12 months for completion.

 



 

Please note there are two things we need from your division:  

1.       We will need the LRS of the off system, to provide to the contractor, for this collection to begin, which will be as early as late October.  

2.       By mid December we must have the updated Caltrans LRS for the contractor to begin that collection.  

 

 

Please let me know when you can provide this information and if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely,

Hi Eric

 

Food for thought.  

 

I would like to add, that I had a meeting with some professors at USC this week and it may be that they are able to add to services for modeling, re-writing the engineering configuration, or preparing the users guide.   USC has some talent, and they  would VERY much like to assist Caltrans, and are willing to do so at reduced rates.   

 

Have a great weekend!

Dear Russell and Tom

 

The department has  ground penetrating radar data from a couple of years ago.   It is in processed, and could potentially be of use to your members.  It has been requested by an organization that would fall with Tom’s scope.   We have not been able to determine a simple way to transfer this data, via online means, due to restrictions in the departments firewalls.  

 

Tom, we will thus send you a disk of the requested data, which we have prepared from the University of California, Davis.

 

Russell, if you would like to let your members know this is available, I would be happy to forward a copy of this statewide data, by a CD.  Below is a sample and format of the data to show what it would look like.  Pay no attention to the color codings.

 



 



 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely, 

Tom Pyle

Hello Navneet, Leo and Fay

 

Chad Baker is soon to provide the Pavement Program with the new LRS.  We would like to attach to this data, the attributes and classifications of the Caltrans system.  

 

I am looking  for information on the functional classes of Caltrans’ state highways.   Also, I am looking for lifeline routes, farm to market routes, (not sure if that is an official term) and gateway routes.  There are some other routes such as Goods Movement and High Emphasis routes.   

 

Our office is developing the Pavement Management System, and this information is very helpful for us to be able to develop pavement rehabilitation priorities across the state.  

 

Do you have this information?

 

Thank you,

Hi Tom,

 

The entirety of the state highway system (minus ramps/connectors) is included in the on-system LRS. This is independent of the functional class assignment for any segment of the SHS.

Hi Tom,

 

We are on track to deliver the on-system LRS by October 6th (original estimate was September 22nd) which includes updates for the 37 routes with identified changes between the Jan 30, 2012  and Jan 30, 2014 TSN data queries.

 

I’ll let Brian cover the off-system LRS item.

Gentlemen

 

Please see the green highlight below…

 

The Pavement Program will need for you to provide the LRS for the off-system collection, which can begin as soon as the contract s awarded.   

 

Also, I will need the LRS for the Caltrans On-system by Mid December.  

 

When will these be delivered?  

 

Thank You,

Brian, Chad

 

The Pavement Program currently has the APCS contract in advertisement.  I have attached the final bid document.  We start contract evaluation on September 22nd.  

 

I would like to bring you up to date on the schedule.   

 

We expect to award the contract by the middle of October.   It will be shortly after that when we will be able to begin the collection.   In the contract we have allocated for 7000 miles of off-system NHS collection, as is shown in the screen shot of the 1st paragraph below.   The On-system will begin on January 2nd for the entire on-system network, and must be completed with-in 8 months.   The off-system has 12 months for completion.

 



 

Please note there are two things we need from your division:  

1.       We will need the LRS of the off system, to provide to the contractor, for this collection to begin, which will be as early as late October.  

2.       By mid December we must have the updated Caltrans LRS for the contractor to begin that collection.  

 

 

Please let me know when you can provide this information and if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely,

Hello Lisa

 

Caltrans has about 15,000 miles of state maintained miles (I believe it is close to 14,600 CL of pavement and another 500 of bridge CL miles).  The number you have referenced is the lane miles.  

 

I do not have the data for the other items you have requested, but I will forward to some who may have that data.

Hi Mr. Pyle,

 

I’m a member of the Research Division of the Texas Legislative Council in Austin, TX. We are working on a request for a member of the legislature, and I’m needing to determine the total number of state-maintained centerline miles in California. I’ve seen this report http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/maint/Pavement/Pavement_Program/PDF/2013_SOP_FINAL-Dec_2013-1-24-13.pdf online but am trying to confirm that 49,720 is indeed the total state-maintained centerline miles only? Also, I’m wondering if you have this total broken down by interstate highways, US highways, state highways/spurs/loops/business routes, Farm or Ranch to market roads/spurs, Pass/park /rec roads, and frontage roads? If so, that would be extremely useful! We are on sort of a short deadline, so any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

 

Lisa

Hi Tom,

 

Attached are files from our office (DOTP) that you requested or may want: IRRS Routes, HE Routes,  and Freight Network (includes FHWA Primary Freight Network 27k and 41K, additional Interstates and state highway and Focus Routes)   Note: we no longer use the Goods Movement Routes that was used in the past.

 

We no longer use lifeline routes.  Note from the Interregional Transportation Strategic Plan Status Update, page 17:  STRATEGIC HIGHWAY NETWORK (STRAHNET) as Lifeline Routes.  For purposes of consistency with federal policy, Caltrans will use the Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) for emergency response planning. The STRAHNET designation was created, and is administered, by the U.S. Department of Defense. It is a nationwide system of highways within the NHS that may be used to transport personnel and equipment in emergencies. It includes a sub-system of “connectors” on State highways and local roads for movement primarily into water ports and military installations. Rather than designate a separate emergency road system, Caltrans will utilize the STRAHNET.

You should be able to get the STRAHNET routes from Navneet’s group.  

 

If you have an old shapefile for Goods Movement Routes, that’s no longer valid.  See attached map and California Freight Mobility Plan (Draft) Document, (Chapter 2-1: Freight System Assets) for explanation on California’s Freight Network. http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tpp/offices/ogm/cfmp.html

 

We do not have farm to market routes or gateway routes.  However, when FHWA finalizes the National Freight Network it will include critical rural freight corridors which may meet your needs.  See: US Code: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2012-title23/pdf/USCODE-2012-title23-chap1-sec167.pdf and NFN: http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/infrastructure/nfn/

 

Thank you,

Fay Meek

Hello Navneet, Leo and Fay

 

Chad Baker is soon to provide the Pavement Program with the new LRS.  We would like to attach to this data, the attributes and classifications of the Caltrans system.  

 

I am looking  for information on the functional classes of Caltrans’ state highways.   Also, I am looking for lifeline routes, farm to market routes, (not sure if that is an official term) and gateway routes.  There are some other routes such as Goods Movement and High Emphasis routes.   

 

Our office is developing the Pavement Management System, and this information is very helpful for us to be able to develop pavement rehabilitation priorities across the state.  

 

Do you have this information?

 

Thank you,

Hi Tom,

 

The entirety of the state highway system (minus ramps/connectors) is included in the on-system LRS. This is independent of the functional class assignment for any segment of the SHS.

Hi Tom,

 

We are on track to deliver the on-system LRS by October 6th (original estimate was September 22nd) which includes updates for the 37 routes with identified changes between the Jan 30, 2012  and Jan 30, 2014 TSN data queries.

 

I’ll let Brian cover the off-system LRS item.

Gentlemen

 

Please see the green highlight below…

 

The Pavement Program will need for you to provide the LRS for the off-system collection, which can begin as soon as the contract s awarded.   

 

Also, I will need the LRS for the Caltrans On-system by Mid December.  

 

When will these be delivered?  

 

Thank You,

Brian, Chad

 

The Pavement Program currently has the APCS contract in advertisement.  I have attached the final bid document.  We start contract evaluation on September 22nd.  

 

I would like to bring you up to date on the schedule.   

 

We expect to award the contract by the middle of October.   It will be shortly after that when we will be able to begin the collection.   In the contract we have allocated for 7000 miles of off-system NHS collection, as is shown in the screen shot of the 1st paragraph below.   The On-system will begin on January 2nd for the entire on-system network, and must be completed with-in 8 months.   The off-system has 12 months for completion.

 



 

Please note there are two things we need from your division:  

1.       We will need the LRS of the off system, to provide to the contractor, for this collection to begin, which will be as early as late October.  

2.       By mid December we must have the updated Caltrans LRS for the contractor to begin that collection.  

 

 

Please let me know when you can provide this information and if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely,
